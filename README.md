### Neuro-GPT: Towards a Foundation Model for EEG  [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03764)

#### Published on IEEE - ISBI 2024

We propose Neuro-GPT, a foundation model consisting of an EEG encoder and a GPT model. The foundation model is pre-trained on a large-scale data set using a self-supervised task that learns how to reconstruct masked EEG segments. We then fine-tune the model on a Motor Imagery Classification task to validate its performance in a low-data regime (9 subjects). Our experiments demonstrate that applying a foundation model can significantly improve classification performance compared to a model trained from scratch.
